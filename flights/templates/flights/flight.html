<!-- The page has a flight booking Form whose 'action' is going to be 'URL of book',
so once submitted is going to recall to the 'book url route' in urls.py,
(the route with 'name="book"'), the view.book, requires as a parameter some 'flight_ID', 
as an argument for what flight the user is booking the passenger on. 
The method of the form submission is going to be POST.
Also whenever I have a form in Django, need to give it the "CSRF token" 
just for security to make sure that Django knows it's really this application 
that is submitting this form and not a hacker, bot or someone else.
The form incudes a dropdown list with a 'select' field in HTML and the name 
of this select field is going to be "passenger", and the reason for that is because 
inside of 'views.book', when get the passenger, looks inside the post data for the field 
whose name is "passenger".
Also, inside of a select dropdown, the user should have a bunch of options for everyone 
who "ISNÂ´T already a passenger" on this flight  (to get acces to everyone who isn't a passenger on the flight 
it is defined the "non_passenger" variable on 'views.flight'). 
Finally this Form has a 'bottom' with an input type 'Submit' to let the user submit the booking form. -->
